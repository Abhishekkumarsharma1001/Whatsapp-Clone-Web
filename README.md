This project is a clone of the WhatsApp web interface created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics the basic functionality of WhatsApp allowing users to send and receive messages through a web browser.


> Responsive Whatsapp Web UI Clone

This project is a clone of the [Whatsapp web UI](https://web.whatsapp.com/login). I made it to study and improve my skills with HTML and CSS, and learn new concepts, Chats layouts, responsiveness, positioning and some JS concepts. Any feedback, opinions or suggestions is very welcome!

The latest update includes some nice new features, such as the gradient border and scroll buttons in stories, and the possibility to add more than one media to the post content, plus, of course, a major overhaul of the UI design!
